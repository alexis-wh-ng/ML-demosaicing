# ML-demosaicing

Photo sensors cannot differentiate colours and the only way to achieve colour imaging is through three- sensor camera, or Colour filter array (CFA). Raw images are captured by this type of camera and creates a mosaic of colours laid out in a Bayer Pattern. Full colour images are digitally restored using demosaicing algorithms. Demosaicing an image using linear regression is experimented in this code and analyzed.
